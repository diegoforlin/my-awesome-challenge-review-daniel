# My Awesome Challenge



This project was made among 4 or 5 weeks with multiple assistances by my superiors Ivan, Luiza and Daniel, which I was able to learn how to create a functional CRUD (Create, Update, Read and Delete) in Swagger-Ui v3.

The core language is Java, with the framework Spring Boot 3.

You will need to load these two local hosts:

http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html

http://localhost:8080/h2-console/login.jsp?jsessionid=e64ef419871da0cec176d155b2f9e244

user: root
pass: root

Hope you enjoy it!!!
